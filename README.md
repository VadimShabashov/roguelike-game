# Roguelike-game

## Description

The project is roguelike-game, where a lonely warrior wanders in a dark maze
full of scary monsters.

Hurry up, help him to escape!

## Gameplay

1. Move main hero with arrow keys.
2. Save current map: `s` key
3. Load map from file: `l` key
4. Start new game (generate new play-board): `n` key

## Start

```
python3 -m src.main
```

## TODO

1. Right now there is no interaction between main hero and monsters: perhaps,
have to add attacks and health
2. The game is endless
3. No comments following the game process (some log below the play-board)
4. Buttons?
5. Add try-catch
